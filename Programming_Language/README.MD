# Programming Language
## Every Language will include all the Basic things you need to know about that language such as Syntex, keywords, so on and will be written in language.language format example c.c for C
## These are more like a CheatSheet rather than a full Doc
For Every Language I will assume you know how to write and run Them.
### [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io) has proper Documentation of all the Languages
### Note:
- if There is any proper Documentation/CheatSheet already I will link to that that
- You will also Find Snippets of Some of the languages in snippet repo in future
## Progress
